# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I was struggling with wrapping my brain around methods. I got a little lost during the lecture, so I am glad I was able to take the time to really understand it. I am feeling much more confident in the topic.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods are great tools for taking an input and returning an output whenever needed. It gives us the ability to make code re-usable.
